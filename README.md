## 📌 Project Overview
Cairo1 is an online **Marketplace** platform that connects **merchants** and **customers** in one place.  
Merchants can create a seller account and use a **Seller Dashboard** to upload and manage products, while customers can browse, search, and purchase products directly.

The platform does not sell products itself. Instead, it works as a **mediator**, earning profit through a **small commission** on each completed sale.  
Because the commission is low and there are no wholesale middlemen, **product prices are lower than traditional market prices**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Provide a simple digital platform that enables merchants to display and sell their products directly.
- Offer a seamless and convenient shopping experience for customers at competitive prices.
- Organize the shipping and order-handling flow clearly and efficiently.
- Achieve sustainable profit for the platform through a commission-based revenue model **without holding inventory**.
