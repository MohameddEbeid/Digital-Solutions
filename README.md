## 📌 Project Overview
Cairo1 is an online **Marketplace** platform that connects **merchants** and **customers** in one place.  
Merchants can upload and manage their products directly on the platform, while customers can browse, search, and purchase products easily.

The platform does not sell products itself. Instead, it acts as a **mediator** and earns revenue through a **small commission** on each sale.  
This business model allows products to be sold at **lower prices** than traditional market prices, as the merchant sells directly to the customer without additional middlemen.

## 🎯 Project Objectives (Marketing Focus)
1. Build strong digital presence and brand awareness for Cairo1.
2. Attract new merchants to register and list their products on the platform.
3. Attract customers to purchase competitively priced products from merchants.
4. Improve the user journey and platform experience through marketing-driven user feedback.
5. Achieve sustainable growth through planned digital marketing campaigns and performance optimization.
